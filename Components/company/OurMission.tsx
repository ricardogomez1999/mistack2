        At Radiant, we are dedicated to transforming the way revenue
        organizations source and close deals. Our mission is to provide our
        customers with an unfair advantage over both their competitors and
        potential customers through insight and analysis. We’ll stop at nothing
        to get you the data you need to close a deal.

        We’re customer-obsessed — putting the time in to build a detailed
        financial picture of every one of our customers so that we know more
        about your business than you do. We are in this together, mostly because
        we are all implicated in large-scale financial crime. In our history as
        a company, we’ve never lost a customer, because if any one of us talks,
        we all go down.
